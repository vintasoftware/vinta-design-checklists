##### Understanding the scope of a feature during a meeting with Product Owners is a key activity in the product design cycle. Designers need to make sure we understand the stakeholder’s vision for it, and what is the goal we’re striving for.

## Briefing with client
#### Ask the following questions during the first sync with your client/product owner. Refer back to them when you’re shaping the feature. Ideas might come up, but try to focus on understanding what value the team is expected to deliver. 

* [ ] What does the user need to achieve?
* [ ] Is there any user data or feedback backing up this feature request?
* [ ] Which pain points need to be fixed/minimized?
* [ ] How will this make our product better?
* [ ] How does this feature align with the product strategy?
* [ ] Which metrics will define this feature’s success? (current/expected)
* [ ] Which metrics can we look at to understand this feature’s outcome once it’s live?
* [ ] What basic behavior is the PO envisioning for this?
    * Only ask this one if you have a straight answer to all the previous questions!

## Understanding user feedback 
#### Try to answer the following questions whenever a feature or improvement based on user feedback comes up as a design assignment. User feedback is very important, but it needs to be treated thoughtfully. The answers to these questions will give the team a clearer picture of how well defined the problem is, help prioritize the feature, and guide the next phases (do more research, or move to the design solution).

* [ ] Are user complaints recurring or anecdotal?
* [ ] What’s the % of our user base that is having this problem?
* [ ] Is this use case common among our user base or specific to one person or context?
* [ ] How critical is the problem? 
* [ ] Is it stopping users from performing an important action? 
    * Is it slowing down users while performing a task?
    *  Is it inducing users to error? Is it driving users out of the product?
    * Is it impacting users' perception of the product as a whole?
    * Is the reported pain point enough to understand the problem and propose a solution?
